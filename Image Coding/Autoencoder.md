# Autoencoder

## ðŸ§  What is an Autoencoder?
- An Autoencoder is a type of **neural network** used to **compress and reconstruct data** â€” usually **unsupervised (no labels required)**.

- It has two main parts: **Encoder&Decoder**

```css
  [ Input Image ]
     â†“
   Encoder      ðŸ”’ (compresses the image into a smaller vector)
     â†“
 Latent Code    ðŸ§  (compact representation â€” like "compressed meaning")
     â†“
   Decoder      ðŸ”“ (reconstructs the image from the latent code)
     â†“
[ Reconstructed Image ]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- The network **learns to keep only the most important information** to **rebuild the original data as closely as possible**
â€” which is exactly **what compression is about!**

## ðŸ”§ Key Components:
- **Encoder**	Maps input to a compressed latent space (e.g., convolutional layers)
- **Latent Space**	Compressed representation of the data
- **Decoder**	Reconstructs the input from the latent vector
